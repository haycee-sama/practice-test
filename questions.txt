38. Interest Rate Plan (Official)
Administrator: Over the last several years, we have more than tripled our revenues, but profits have consistently declined due to a rising number of purchasers who have failed to pay their balances.

This raise will be enough to make up for the lost profits. Which of the following statements, if true, would most seriously undermine the plan?
A) Many other firms have undergone a similar tendency in their default rates.
B) The firm's operating expenses are above the company’s average and can be considerably reduced, thus raising margins.

A) The engineers in-charge of the design and construction of the rocket ship are subjected to a meticulous screening step.
B) Every spaceship uses a distinct color scheme, which matches that of every firm’s logo.
C) Most workers recently in the employ of firm Y were working for firm Z before the establishment of the rocket ship.

Which of the following best identifies the weakness in Salim’s conclusion?
A) The claim Salim cites comes from only observed occurrence, that of Firm Y.
B) The profitability of Firm Y might be only for a while.
C) Salim’s statement is open to the possibility that the cause he cites came after the impact he assigns to it.

Passage: Throughout history, strong leaders have been described by their traits. Therefore, leadership research has long sought to identify the personality, social, physical, or intellectual attributes that differentiate leaders from non-leaders. Trait theories of leadership focus on personal qualities and characteristics. Leadership emergence and effectiveness are often evaluated separately vis-à-vis trait studies. For personality, a comprehensive review of the leadership literature organized around the Big Five framework has found extraversion to be the most predictive trait of effective leadership. However, extraversion sometimes relates more to the way leaders emerge than to their effectiveness. Sociable and dominant people are more likely to assert themselves in group situations, which can help extraverts be identified as leaders, but effective leaders are not domineering. One study found leaders who scored remarkably high in assertiveness, a facet of extraversion, were less effective than those who were moderately high. So, although extraversion can predict effective leadership, the relationship may be due to unique facets of the trait. Unlike agreeableness and emotional stability, which seem not to predict leadership, conscientiousness, and openness to experience may predict leadership, especially leader effectiveness. For example, one recent study indicated that top management teams that were high in conscientiousness positively influenced organizational performance through their leadership. Conscientiousness and extraversion are positively related to leaders’ self-efficacy, and people are more likely to follow someone who is confident he or she is going in the right direction, allowing these leaders to emerge. In sum, leaders who like being around people and can assert themselves (extraverted), are disciplined and able to keep commitments they make (conscientious) and are creative and flexible (open) have an apparent advantage when it comes to leadership.
