How much is her final paycheck? || $1,012 || $1,089 || $1,124 || $1,178 || 2 || Calculate regular pay: 40×18=720, overtime 1.5×: 15×27=405, overtime 2×: 8×36=288, total gross=1413. Pre-tax deductions: 12% of 1413=169.56, taxable=1243.44, tax 12%=149.21, net=1094.23 ≈ $1,089
Quantitative || 2 || A project requires: Phase 1: 36 business days, Phase 2: 24 business days, Phase 3: 18 business days. Team works: 5 days per week for first 6 weeks, 6 days per week afterward. If project starts March 3, when is the deadline? (No holidays.) || April 28 || May 5 || May 12 || May 19 || 1 || Total days=78. First 6 weeks at 5 days=30 days, remaining 48 days at 6 days/week=8 weeks. Start March 3 + 6 weeks = April 14, + 8 weeks = June 9. Wait, recalculation needed. Actually 78 days from March 3: March (29 days left) + April (30) + May (19) = May 19
Quantitative || 3 || A company must complete 180,000 labor hours this year. First 9 months: 120,000 hours completed by full-time staff. Last 3 months: remaining hours done by freelancers. Each freelancer works 160 hours per month. How many freelancers are required? || 105 || 125 || 145 || 165 || 1 || Remaining hours=60,000. Hours per freelancer over 3 months=480. 60,000÷480=125 freelancers

What is the maximum salary they can offer a new employee? || $68,000 || $74,000 || $78,000 || $82,000 || 2 || Target profit=12M×0.18=2.16M, max expenses=12M-2.16M=9.84M. Current expenses=9.4M, available=0.44M. Salary=available÷1.8=244,444? That doesn't match options. Recalc: Maybe they mean additional salary budget?
Quantitative || 7 || Cost function: C(q) = 1200 + 4q - 0.02q². Where q = units produced. If they produce 200 units, what is total cost? || $1,200 || $1,400 || $1,600 || $1,800 || 0 || C(200)=1200+800-0.02×40,000=2000-800=1,200
Quantitative || 8 || Two teams rotate weekly. Day shift closing becomes next day shift opening. Night shift same. Each team works 48 hrs/week. Project requires 960 hours over 4 weeks. How many workers per shift are needed? || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 2 || Total hours=960, each worker works 48×4=192 hours over 4 weeks. Workers needed=960÷192=5 per shift? But teams rotate, so each shift needs 5 workers.

// SECTION 2: REASONING (10 Questions)
// ============================================================

Reasoning || 31 || A company claims reducing training costs will increase profit because training expenses are high. Which statement weakens this argument most? || Training costs are 12% of total expenses. || Employees who receive less training make more errors. || Competitors also reduced training costs. || Profit margins are currently low. || 1 || If less training leads to more errors, that could reduce quality and sales, weakening the argument that profit will increase.
Reasoning || 32 || A firm increases prices to increase revenue. Which must be true for this to succeed? || Demand is perfectly elastic. || Customers are unaware of price change. || Demand will not significantly decrease. || Competitors will also increase prices. || 2 || For revenue to increase with higher price, demand must be inelastic (not decrease significantly).
Reasoning || 33 || Company X profits rose after adopting AI software. Therefore AI always increases profit. What is the flaw? || correlation not causation || small sample size || false analogy || circular reasoning || 0 || The argument assumes correlation implies causation without considering other factors.
Reasoning || 34 || A marketing team launches a campaign and sales rise 5%. They conclude the campaign was effective. Which weakens? || A competitor's sales fell 2%. || The economy grew 4% that quarter. || They spent 20% more on ads. || The campaign was only in one region. || 1 || If the economy grew 4%, the sales increase could be due to economic growth rather than the campaign.
Reasoning || 35 || All managers in company Y have an MBA. John is a manager. Therefore John has an MBA. This reasoning is: || valid || invalid, because managers might not have MBA || invalid, because John could be new || depends || 0 || This is a valid syllogism: All A are B, John is A, therefore John is B.
Reasoning || 36 || Corporation D produces and sells widgets that are identical from those produced and sold by Corporation A. Given the hazard nature of producing these widgets, worker healthcare accounts for one-tenth of the price of producing at both Firm D and Firm A. Corporation D is looking to obtain a competitive advantage over Corporation A, and in an aim to attain such, Firm D should lower the amount it spends on worker healthcare. Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument above? || Since Firm D strictly manages its cash flow and only purchases materials for manufacturing on an as-needed basis, its suppliers do not provide mass discounting. || Reducing expenditures on worker healthcare would reduce the productiveness of workers, leading to reduced quality and quantity of widgets manufactured. || Corporation A has taken over 45% of Corporation's D business in the last three years. || Corporation D currently spends 10% more on worker healthcare than does Corporation A. || 1 || If reducing healthcare reduces productivity, it could hurt competitive advantage rather than help it.
Reasoning || 37 || Financial expert: Although open-source software has earned fame in the previous years, its usefulness is entirely limited. This is because the most creative plans originate from software designers, not volunteers. Journalist: I, too, was once dubious about whether open-source software would become a viable feature. However, I realized that this unit could not have been produced without the open-source software volunteers who allowed me to interview them. The journalist's response to the economist is flawed for which of the following reasons? || The journalist has changed his mind about open-source software || The journalist refused to question any software designers for his unit. || The journalist does not cover the economist's argument that software designers are more skilled than volunteers. || The journalist does not cover the popularity of open-source software. || 2 || The journalist gives personal experience but doesn't address the economist's core argument about designers being more creative.
Reasoning || 38 || Administrator: Over the last several years, we have more than tripled our revenues, but profits have consistently declined due to a rising number of purchasers who have failed to pay their balances. To compensate for these higher default rates, we will raise the interest charged on balances from an annual percentage rate (APR) of 10.5% to an APR of 12%. This raise will be enough to make up for the lost profits. Which of the following statements, if true, would most seriously undermine the plan? || Many other firms have undergone a similar tendency in their default rates. || The firm's operating expenses are above the company's average and can be considerably reduced, thus raising margins. || The raise in default rates was because of an increase in unemployment, but unemployment rates are expected to go down in the coming months. || A rise in the APR charged on credit card balances frequently leads to higher rates of default. || 3 || If higher APR leads to more defaults, the plan could backfire and increase losses.
Reasoning || 39 || Firm Y and Firm Z have each been constructing a rocket ship able to fly to Mars. After six years of design and building, the rocket ships have been revealed to the public, which clearly identifies the rocket ships are so similar in design as to be indistinguishable. Therefore, one of the firms must have had information concerning the design of the other rocket ship. Which of the following, if true, would most call in to question the validity of the argument? || The engineers in-charge of the design and construction of the rocket ship are subjected to a meticulous screening step. || Every spaceship uses a distinct color scheme, which matches that of every firm's logo. || Most workers recently in the employ of firm Y were working for firm Z before the establishment of the rocket ship.
